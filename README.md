## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease remains a leading global cause of mortality. Early identification significantly improves patient outcomes.  
This project uses machine learning techniques to classify patients based on demographic and clinical measurements.

The study covers:

- Rigorous **data preprocessing & cleaning**
- Extensive **EDA**
- Multiple **outlier‑detection frameworks**
- Training & evaluation of **six ML models**
- Visualizations, interpretability elements, and model comparison

## 📊 Dataset Summary

The dataset contains **303 samples** and **14 numeric features**, including patient demographics, clinical exam results, and stress-test outcomes.

### Target Variable
- `target`:  
  - `1` — heart disease present  
  - `0` — no heart disease  

### Categorical Features
`sex`, `cp`, `fbs`, `restecg`, `exang`, `slope`, `ca`, `thal`, `target`

### Numerical Features
`age`, `trestbps`, `chol`, `thalach`, `oldpeak`

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps include:

- Duplicate detection & removal  
- Type consistency checks  
- Categorical & numerical feature separation  
- Handling invalid values (simple/KNN imputation)  
- Outlier detection using:
  - IQR  
  - Isolation Forest  
  - Local Outlier Factor (LOF)  
  - Regression residual analysis  
  - Rare-category detection  

### Scaling & Encoding
Depending on the model:

- StandardScaler  
- RobustScaler  
- PowerTransformer  
- OneHotEncoder  
- ColumnTransformer pipelines

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook provides extensive visual and statistical analysis:

- Histograms & distributions  
- Countplots for categorical variables  
- Boxplots with/without target hue  
- Pairplots (full & reduced)  
- Full and reduced correlation heatmaps  
- Top-correlation extraction for each feature  
- Relationship visualizations (scatter, categorical comparisons)

These analyses guide modeling choices and help identify influential predictors.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Six supervised models were developed and evaluated:

### 1️⃣ Decision Tree Classifier
- Entropy criterion  
- Controlled depth to avoid overfitting  
- 10‑fold cross‑validation  

### 2️⃣ Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Winsorization of extreme values  
- PowerTransformer + StandardScaler pipeline  
- Stratified 5‑fold CV  

### 3️⃣ K‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- StandardScaler  
- Search over k = 1–20  
- Stratified 5‑fold CV (Accuracy, F1, ROC‑AUC)

### 4️⃣ Logistic Regression
- Comparison of multiple outlier‑handling methods  
- ColumnTransformer pipeline  
- Metrics: Accuracy, F1, ROC‑AUC (via cross‑validation)

### 5️⃣ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- RobustScaler  
- GridSearchCV for kernel, C, gamma  
- ROC‑based threshold optimization  
- Train/validation/test evaluation  

### 6️⃣ Random Forest
- Baseline + GridSearchCV tuning  
- Feature importance analysis  
- 5‑fold cross‑validation  

All models include confusion matrices, classification reports, and consistency checks.
